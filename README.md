# 📊 5-Year ROI of Sponsorship – A Data Analytics Case Study

### 💡 Project Objective
This project answers a critical business question for UK employers:  
**“When does sponsoring international talent actually start paying back?”**

Using SQL for modelling and Tableau for visualization, I built a complete 5-year ROI analysis comparing sponsorship vs. non-sponsorship hiring decisions — showing how long-term retention and reduced turnover drive profit, not cost.

### 🧱 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **data_sql/** | Raw input data for base scenarios, sponsorship fees, and time periods. |
| **sql/** | SQL scripts for creating tables, calculating ROI logic, and verifying outputs. |
| **outputs/** | Final results — ROI CSVs, visual charts, and Tableau dashboard file (.twbx). |
| **visualize_roi.py** | Python automation script for exporting SQL results and generating charts. |

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Break-even in Month 1:** Sponsorship delivers a **+£6.6K net advantage** immediately by avoiding recruitment/training costs.  
- **Year 3 ROI:** Sponsorship ≈ **£20.8K** vs. **£7K** (non-sponsorship).  
- **Year 5 ROI:** Sponsorship ≈ **£25K** vs. **£7K** cumulative.  
- **Retention impact:** Sponsored employees stay longer, reducing turnover and rehire cycles by ~2.5x.  
- **Conclusion:** Sponsorship isn’t a cost — it’s a **strategic long-term investment**.

### 🗂️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:** Defined sponsorship and non-sponsorship scenarios, fees, and retention assumptions in SQL.  
2. **ROI Modelling:** Created monthly and annual cumulative ROI calculations using SQL views.  
3. **Validation:** Verified output values against sanity checks (Month 1, Year 3, Year 5).  
4. **Visualization:** Built Tableau dashboards to compare both scenarios visually.  
5. **Publication:** Hosted full workflow on GitHub and Tableau Public for transparency.

### 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates how **data analytics** can convert assumptions into business insights.  
By quantifying sponsorship ROI, it challenges the misconception that “visa sponsorship is too costly” — showing instead that **investing in global talent yields measurable long-term value**.
